            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Argo Sales Tracker. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of our website, community
                forums, and the Argo Sales Tracker software (collectively, the "Service"). By accessing or using the
                Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, you may not
                access the Service.</p>

            <h2>Account Terms</h2>
            <p>When you create an account with us, you must provide accurate and complete information. You are
                responsible for maintaining the security of your account, and you are fully responsible for all
                activities that occur under your account.</p>
            <p>You must immediately notify us of any unauthorized uses of your account or any other breaches of
                security. We will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind
                incurred as a result of such acts or omissions.</p>
            <p>The Argo Sales Tracker desktop application collects anonymous usage statistics and geographic information
                by default to help us improve the quality and performance of our desktop software. This includes
                operational data, API usage, error tracking, session information, and geographic data (country, region,
                city, timezone) to identify and resolve software issues and optimize performance
                globally. You can disable this feature at any time in the Settings panel of the application. This data
                collection is separate from any standard web analytics used on our website. For more information about
                what data is collected and how it is used, please see our <a class="link" href="privacy.php">Privacy
                    Policy</a>.</p>

            </ol>
